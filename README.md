# sec-prng : Secure pseudo-random number generation

## TL;DR

JavaDoc for this project can be found [here](http://simon-greatrix.github.io/sec-prng/doc/).

## What is this?

Good cryptography needs securely generated random numbers. Java does not provide a random number generator that meets the needs of modern strong cryptography. This library fixes that.

## How do I use it?

Read the installation instructions. Use it.
